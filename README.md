# Convenience Images
A place for publishing dockerfiles that come in handy sometimes.

These images can be used to speed up github actions in the event that specific dependencies need to be installed.

## Rust Diesel

Built on top of the rust image, but includes an installation of the `diesel-client` with postgres features. It can be used to run database migrations.
